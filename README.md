# KRT - Kader's Raid Utilities

This addon was part of [KPack](https://github.com/bkader/KPack), it was extracted and made as a standalone addon after few requests.

# Modules

The addon currently contains **6** modules, but more can be added if needed/requested and judged useful.

## Raid Menu

This is a simple menu that can be positioned anywhere you want (_right-click to move_) and allows raid leaders/officers to execute some tasks in a single click: _Disband Group_, assign _Main Tank_ & _Main Assist_, do a _Ready Check_, open _Raid Frame_ and _Converts party to raid_.

## Loot Method

Allows you to configuration the loot methods to use in _party_ or _raid_, as well as the loot threshold. Whenever you create a party or a raid, it automatically sets those for you. Command: `/loot`.

## Auto Invites

If you are familiar with **oRA3** auto invite feature, this is the same. It offers a set of buttons to use to quickly invites guild members and allows you to set invite _keywords_, if players whisper you those keywords they will be automatically invited. Command: `/invites`.

## Paladin Auras

Allows you to track paladin auras in your party or raid. It only shows the aura you have, so if more than one paladin are using the same aura, only the caster of the one you have is shown. It also tracks _Aura Mastery_, as soon as it is used, it shows its icon near the player who used it. Command: `/auras`.

## Healers Mana

Tracks the mana of healers in your party or raid. It shows the percentages of their mana left if they are alive, and _Dead_ or _Offline_ if they are. It also shows the _Drinking_ icon with cooldown whenever they are drinking. Command: `/mana`.

## Sunder Armor

It tracks _Sunder Armor_ usage. If the display header (_title_) is shown, you can right-click on it to open a menu to **Report** or **Reset** counter. If you choose to hide the title, you can always used the provided slash commands. Commands: `/sunder`, `/sunder report` and `/sunder reset`
